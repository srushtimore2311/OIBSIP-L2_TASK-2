          <h2>The man who brought education to the masses</h2> 
          <p>
            <b>Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil (22 September 1887 – 9 May 1959), born in Kumbhoj, Kolhapur, was a social activist and educator in Maharashtra, India. A strong advocate of mass education, he founded the Rayat Education Society. Bhaurao played an important role in educating backward castes and low income people by coining the philosophy earn and learn. He was a prominent member of Satyashodhak Samaj (Truth seeker's society), founded by Mahatma Jyotirao Phule. The people of Maharashtra honoured him with the sobriquet Karmaveer (King of actions) and the Government of India awarded him with Padma Bhushan in 1959 in India.
                Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil was born in a Marathi Jain farming family at Kumbhoj in Kolhapur district. Bhaurao's father was a clerk in the revenue department for East India company.[citation needed] Bhaurao was one of the first few Jains known to have passed 8th class of secondary school. During childhood, Bhaurao was heavily influenced by Chhatrapati Shahu, the ruler of Kolhapur State, who provided a facility to Bhaurao to stay in the palace of Kolhapur with Maharaj and study. Shahu was promoter of social equality and education of people belonging to backward castes. Eventually, his father sent him to Kolhapur for further education, where he got in contact with Satya Shodhak Movement and found other sources of inspiration, Mahatma Phule and Maharshi Vitthal Ramji Shinde.

          <h3>Social Work</h3>
            <p>When he was small that time he saw one man not allowing other people from another caste to drink water from a well so he totally broke that well and beaten that person too. This shows how he was against discrimination since childhood.

                Chatrapati Shahu Maharaj influenced him a lot. His thinking encourages him to work his whole life. He got full support from Maharaj too. There he was attached to Satyasodhak Samaj. He works with them for the welfare of people. His idols were Mahatma Phule and Maharishi Vitthal Ramji Shinde.
                
                After leaving school he started private tuition with some of his friends like madvan teacher, bhausaheb kudale, nana saheb yedekar in 1909 name “Dudhgav Vidyarthi ashram“. This was his first step toward
                
                In Sep 1911 in Satyasodhak Samaj Parishad, he finally got approval for education society for Bahujan people in kale village. But on 4 Oct 1919, he finally started “Rayat Shikshan Sanstha” in Satara kale village. “Rayat” is actually Marathi word meaning ‘masses’. He was one of the prominent men in history to start the scheme “Learn and Earn“. This scheme made students from Bahujan samaj self-reliant and independent.
                
            Bhaurao garnered political interest and decided to express his role in the fight for Indian freedom struggle by working in other beneficial fields like public education. While he worked for companies such as Ogale glassworks, Kirloskars and Coopers, he participated in the activities of Satya Shodhak Samaj. He had realized by then that the only remedy for the social evils of those times was the education of the masses. In 1919, he started a hostel where children from lower castes and poor families could stay and get an education while working to pay the expenses. This was the foundation of what later became Rayat Shikshan Sansthan.

                As Bhaurao started working on his program to educate the masses, Gandhiji had also launched his campaign to free India (independence movement). During a public meeting in 1921, Bhaurao happened to come across Gandhiji at Mumbai. He was highly impressed by Gandhi's appearance in a loincloth and his philosophy of Khadi. Following this encounter, Bhaurao decided to adopt Khadi attire and follow Gandhian principles in everyday living. Eventually, he vowed to see it to completion, establishing 101 schools in Gandhi's name. However, Gandhiji and Bhaurao had a difference of opinion on the subject of accepting grants from the government for educational activities in post-independence India. Gandhiji believed that even if the government wanted to give grants in aid to an educational institute (or institutes) without putting any restrictions on the institutes, this would eventually devolve into edicts and oversight. No one can expect to receive money without conditions forever. Bhaurao saw no such problem with accepting grants from the government.
